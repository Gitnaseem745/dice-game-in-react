# Dice Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple yet interactive Dice Game built using React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router. The game is fully responsive and designed to work seamlessly on all devices.

## Project Overview

In this project, the player rolls a dice after selecting a number from 1 to 6. If the rolled number matches the selected number, the score increases by 1. If it doesn't match, the score decreases by 1. The game also includes several features to enhance the user experience, such as score resetting, rule checking, and number selection validation.

### Features

- **Number Selection:** Before rolling the dice, the player must select a number. If no number is selected, a warning message is displayed.
- **Dice Roll:** Clicking on the dice rolls it to a random number between 1 and 6.
- **Score Management:** The score increases by 1 if the rolled number matches the selected number and decreases by 1 if it doesn't.
- **Reset Score:** A button allows the player to reset the score to 0.
- **Toggle Rules:** Players can view or hide the game rules by clicking a button.

### Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the SPA and managing the state and components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and making the game responsive across all devices.
- **React Router:** For routing between the home page and the game page.
